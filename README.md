# Credit Risk Analysis
Predicting credit risk using Machine Learning models
----

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.

### Overview

The credit industry can be very risky, classifying potential customers as a good or poor risk is vital to the financial health of the credit provider. In this module I used various libraries and algorithms to build and evaluate models to predict each person's credit risk. These include:
<br>
• imbalanced-learn<BR>
• scikit-learn<BR>
• RandomOverSampler<BR>
• SMOTE algorithms<BR>
• ClusterCentroids algorithm<BR>
• SMOTEENN algorithm<BR>
• BalancedRandomForestClassifier<BR>
• EasyEnsembleClassifier<BR>
